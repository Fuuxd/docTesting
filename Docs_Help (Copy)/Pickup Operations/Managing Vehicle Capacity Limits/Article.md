**100% Full** - Red alert preventing new assignments
**Overweight Alert** - Immediate notification of weight violations

## Route Assignment with Capacity

### Automatic Capacity Checking
- System verifies capacity before route assignment
- Prevents overloading during pickup planning
- Suggests alternative vehicles when needed
- Optimizes load distribution across fleet

### Manual Override Options
**Temporary Increase** - Allow slight overload for specific routes
**Split Routes** - Divide large routes between multiple vehicles
**Priority Loading** - Assign high-priority packages first
**Capacity Warnings** - Acknowledge and proceed with caution

## Vehicle Types and Configurations

**Typical Capacity** - 500-1000 lbs, 50-100 cubic feet
**Package Limit** - 20-50 packages
**Best Use** - Local deliveries, small packages
**Fuel Efficiency** - High MPG for urban routes

### Medium Vehicles (Box Trucks)
**Typical Capacity** - 1000-3000 lbs, 200-500 cubic feet
**Package Limit** - 100-200 packages
**Best Use** - Regional routes, medium volume
**Special Features** - Lift gate, loading dock access

### Large Vehicles (Semi-Trucks)
**Typical Capacity** - 10000+ lbs, 1000+ cubic feet
**Package Limit** - 500+ packages
**Best Use** - Long-haul, high volume routes
**Requirements** - CDL license, specialized training

## Load Planning and Optimization

### Pickup Load Calculation
- System calculates total weight of scheduled pickups
- Estimates volume based on package dimensions
- Considers pickup sequence and loading order
- Suggests optimal vehicle assignment

### Delivery Load Management
- Tracks package removal during delivery stops
- Updates available capacity in real-time
- Allows for additional pickup assignments
- Optimizes return trip capacity usage

## Capacity Reporting

### Vehicle Utilization Reports
1. Go to **Reports** section
2. Select **Vehicle Utilization** report
3. Choose date range and specific vehicles
4. View capacity usage statistics

### Report Metrics
**Average Utilization** - Percentage of capacity typically used
**Peak Usage Times** - When vehicles reach maximum capacity
**Efficiency Ratings** - Capacity usage vs. fuel consumption
**Underutilized Vehicles** - Vehicles with low capacity usage

## Capacity Violations and Handling

### Overweight Situations
**Immediate Alerts** - Notification when weight limits exceeded
**Safety Protocols** - Required actions for overweight vehicles
**Load Redistribution** - Options for moving packages
**Violation Logging** - Record keeping for safety compliance

### Volume Overloads
**Physical Constraints** - Packages won't fit in vehicle
**Loading Assistance** - Suggest better loading techniques
**Alternative Arrangements** - Recommend different vehicle
**Customer Communication** - Notify of potential delays

## Fleet Capacity Planning

### Demand Forecasting
- Analyze historical capacity usage patterns
- Predict peak capacity requirements
- Plan vehicle acquisitions based on growth
- Optimize fleet mix for operational needs

### Seasonal Adjustments
**Holiday Peaks** - Temporary capacity increases
**Weather Impacts** - Reduced capacity during bad weather
**Service Expansions** - Additional capacity for new areas
**Maintenance Schedules** - Plan for reduced capacity periods
