# Understanding Pickup Route Optimization

Learn how Nearfleet Portal automatically optimizes pickup routes for maximum efficiency and how you can customize the optimization process.

## Route Optimization Overview

### What Route Optimization Does
The system automatically arranges pickup stops to:
- **Minimize Total Distance**: Reduce overall miles driven
- **Reduce Travel Time**: Account for traffic patterns and road conditions
- **Balance Vehicle Capacity**: Ensure pickups don't exceed vehicle limits
- **Optimize Timing**: Consider pickup time windows and constraints
- **Maximize Efficiency**: Complete more pickups in less time

### When Optimization Occurs
Route optimization happens:
- **Automatically**: When creating new pickup routes
- **On Schedule Changes**: When pickup times are modified
- **With New Stops**: When additional pickups are added to routes
- **Manual Trigger**: When you click "Optimize Route" button
- **Daily Planning**: During overnight route planning processes
