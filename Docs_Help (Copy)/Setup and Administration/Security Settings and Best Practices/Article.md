# Security Settings and Best Practices

Implement security best practices and configure security settings to protect your logistics operations.

## Essential Security Settings

### Password Security
**Minimum Length** - Set 12+ character requirement

### Account Protection
1. Navigate to **Settings > Security > Account Protection**
2. Enable account lockout after 5 failed attempts
3. Set 30-minute lockout duration
4. Configure administrator unlock capabilities
5. Enable suspicious activity monitoring

## Multi-Factor Authentication Setup

### Enabling Organization-Wide MFA
1. Go to **Settings > Security > Multi-Factor Authentication**
2. Set enforcement policy to "Required for All Users"
3. Allow 30-day grace period for user setup
4. Configure backup authentication methods
5. Test MFA functionality before enforcement

### Supported MFA Methods
**Authenticator Apps** - Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator
**SMS Verification** - Text message codes (less secure)
**Email Codes** - Email-based verification
**Hardware Tokens** - Physical security keys (most secure)

### MFA Best Practices
- Require MFA for all administrative accounts
- Use authenticator apps over SMS when possible
- Maintain backup recovery codes securely
- Regular MFA method review and updates
- Train users on MFA setup and usage

## Network Security

### IP Address Restrictions
**Office Networks** - Whitelist company IP addresses
**VPN Requirements** - Require VPN for remote access
**Geographic Blocking** - Block access from high-risk countries
**Dynamic IP Handling** - Configure for mobile workers

### Network Monitoring
1. Enable real-time login monitoring
2. Set alerts for unusual login locations
3. Monitor for concurrent sessions from different IPs
4. Track and investigate suspicious access patterns
5. Implement automatic blocking for threats

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards
**Data at Rest** - AES-256 encryption for stored data
**Data in Transit** - TLS 1.3 for all communications
**Database Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive database fields
**Backup Encryption** - Secure backup file encryption

### Access Controls
**Role-Based Access** - Limit access to necessary functions only
**Data Segregation** - Separate sensitive data by access level
**Audit Trails** - Track all data access and modifications
**Regular Reviews** - Quarterly access permission audits

## User Security Training

### Security Awareness Topics
**Password Security** - Creating and managing strong passwords
**Phishing Recognition** - Identifying suspicious emails and links
**Social Engineering** - Recognizing manipulation attempts
**Mobile Security** - Securing mobile devices and apps

### Training Implementation
1. Schedule mandatory security training quarterly
2. Include real-world scenarios and examples
3. Test knowledge with simulated phishing attempts
4. Track completion and comprehension rates
5. Update training based on emerging threats

## Incident Response Procedures

### Security Incident Classification
**Level 1** - Minor security violations (password sharing)
**Level 2** - Moderate threats (suspicious login attempts)
**Level 3** - Major incidents (data breach attempts)
**Level 4** - Critical threats (active security breaches)

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate Response** - Contain and assess threat
2. **Investigation** - Determine scope and impact
3. **Remediation** - Fix vulnerabilities and restore security
4. **Communication** - Notify stakeholders appropriately
5. **Follow-up** - Implement improvements and monitor

## System Monitoring

### Security Monitoring Dashboard
**Login Activity** - Real-time login success/failure tracking
**User Behavior** - Unusual activity pattern detection
**System Access** - Administrative action monitoring
**Data Export** - Tracking of sensitive data exports

### Automated Alerts
1. Configure immediate alerts for security events:
   - Multiple failed login attempts
   - Administrative privilege escalation
   - Large data exports
   - Access from new geographic locations
   - Off-hours system access

## Backup Security

### Secure Backup Practices
**Encrypted Backups** - All backups encrypted at rest
**Offsite Storage** - Backups stored in separate locations
**Access Controls** - Limited backup access permissions
**Retention Policies** - Secure deletion of old backups

### Backup Verification
- Test backup restoration monthly
- Verify backup encryption integrity
- Maintain backup access logs
- Regular backup security audits
- Document backup recovery procedures

## Compliance Requirements

### Industry Standards
**SOC 2 Type II** - Security control frameworks
**GDPR Compliance** - European data protection requirements
**HIPAA** - Healthcare data protection (if applicable)
**PCI DSS** - Payment card data security (if processing payments)

### Compliance Monitoring
1. Regular compliance assessments
2. Document security control implementation
3. Maintain audit trails for compliance reporting
4. Schedule external security audits annually
5. Implement recommended improvements

## Mobile Security

### Mobile Device Management
**Device Encryption** - Require encryption on all mobile devices
**App Store Restrictions** - Use official app stores only
**Remote Wipe** - Capability to remotely clear device data
**Update Requirements** - Mandate timely security updates

### Mobile App Security
- Use official Nearfleet mobile applications only
- Enable app-level security features
- Regular security updates and patches
- Secure API communications
- Local data encryption on devices

## Third-Party Integration Security

### API Security
**Authentication** - Strong API key management
**Rate Limiting** - Prevent API abuse
**Encryption** - Secure API communications
**Monitoring** - Track API usage and anomalies

### Vendor Security Assessment
1. Evaluate security practices of integration partners
2. Require security certifications from vendors
3. Regular security reviews of third-party connections
4. Incident response coordination with partners
5. Secure data sharing agreements
