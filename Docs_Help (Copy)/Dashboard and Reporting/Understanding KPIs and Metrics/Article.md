# Understanding KPIs and Metrics

Your dashboard displays six key performance indicators that provide real-time insight into your logistics operations.

## KPI Card Layout

Each KPI card shows:
- **Large Number**: Current metric value
- **Metric Name**: Description of what's being measured
- **Trend Arrow**: Green (up), red (down), or gray (no change)
- **Percentage**: Change from previous time period

## The Six Core KPIs

### 1. Pickup Jobs
**What It Shows**: Total number of scheduled pickup operations
- **Includes**: Pending pickups, in-progress pickups, completed pickups
- **Map Indicator**: Purple markers show pickup locations
- **Use Case**: Monitor pickup workload and scheduling efficiency

### 2. Delivery Jobs
**What It Shows**: Total number of active delivery operations
- **Includes**: Out for delivery, in transit, scheduled deliveries  
- **Map Indicator**: Blue markers show packages pending delivery
- **Use Case**: Track active delivery volume and operational capacity

### 3. Drivers Assigned
**What It Shows**: Number of drivers currently assigned to active routes
- **Includes**: Drivers on pickup routes, delivery routes, and transfers
- **Use Case**: Monitor resource utilization and staffing levels
- **Optimization**: Compare to workload to identify over/under-staffing

### 4. Pickup Stops Completed
**What It Shows**: Number of pickup locations successfully serviced
- **Calculation**: Completed pickup stops ÷ total scheduled stops × 100
- **Use Case**: Measure pickup operation efficiency and progress
- **Target**: Higher percentages indicate better operational performance

### 5. Packages Delivered
**What It Shows**: Total packages successfully delivered to recipients
- **Includes**: Signed deliveries, safe location drops, neighbor deliveries
- **Map Indicator**: Green markers show successful deliveries
- **Use Case**: Track delivery completion rate and customer satisfaction

### 6. Exceptions
**What It Shows**: Failed deliveries or packages requiring special attention
- **Includes**: Delivery failures, damaged packages, access issues, wrong addresses
- **Map Indicator**: Red markers show problem packages
- **Use Case**: Identify problem areas requiring immediate attention

## Understanding Trend Indicators

### Green Up Arrow (↗)
- **Meaning**: Metric improved compared to previous period
- **Examples**: More deliveries completed, fewer exceptions
- **Action**: Continue current practices, identify success factors

### Red Down Arrow (↘)
- **Meaning**: Metric declined compared to previous period  
- **Examples**: Fewer pickups completed, more exceptions
- **Action**: Investigate causes, implement corrective measures

### Gray Dash (—)
- **Meaning**: No significant change from previous period
- **Interpretation**: Stable performance, consistent operations
- **Action**: Monitor for changes, maintain current performance

## KPI Calculations

### Delivery Success Rate
- **Formula**: (Packages Delivered ÷ Total Packages) × 100
- **Good Range**: 95-98% for most operations
- **Low Rate Causes**: Address issues, access problems, damaged packages

### Driver Utilization
- **Formula**: (Drivers Assigned ÷ Total Available Drivers) × 100
- **Optimal Range**: 70-85% for efficient operations
- **High Utilization**: May indicate understaffing
- **Low Utilization**: May indicate overstaffing or low demand

### Exception Rate
- **Formula**: (Exceptions ÷ Total Packages) × 100
- **Target**: Less than 5% for well-managed operations
- **High Exceptions**: Investigate common failure causes

## Time Period Comparisons

### Dashboard Time Filters
- **Today**: Compare to yesterday
- **This Week**: Compare to previous week
- **This Month**: Compare to previous month
- **Custom Range**: Compare to equivalent previous period

### Seasonal Considerations
- **Holiday Periods**: Expect higher volumes and different patterns
- **Weather Events**: May increase exceptions and delays
- **Business Cycles**: Monthly/quarterly patterns in demand

## Using KPIs for Decision Making

### Daily Operations
- **High Exceptions**: Dispatch additional support or investigate causes
- **Low Driver Utilization**: Reassign resources or adjust schedules
- **Poor Pickup Completion**: Review route planning and time allocation

### Performance Monitoring
- **Week-over-Week**: Identify operational trends
- **Month-over-Month**: Assess longer-term performance changes
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Compare against industry standards

### Resource Planning
- **Driver Staffing**: Use utilization metrics to guide hiring decisions
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor volume trends for expansion planning
- **Quality Improvement**: Use exception data to identify training needs
